                <h2 class="font-SF text-base font-light">
                    The Spanish Government adopted in 2020 the Digital Strategy 2025, which aims to promote the digital transformation of the country through digital connectivity, strengthened cybersecurity, digitalization of public administrations and incorporation of artificial intelligence technologies, among other initiatives. <br> <br>
                    Additional planned investments are compiled in the Spanish Government Recovery, Transformation, and Resilience Plan. The plan, announced on April 30th, 2021, for the period 2021-2023, outlines the roadmap for the modernization of the Spanish economy, the recovery of economic growth and job creation, and responds to the challenges of the next decade. This long-term perspective is expected to drive technology investment decisions both in the public and private spheres. The expected investment in these programs is USD 17.25 billion.Digital transformation and cloud adoption is driving investment in data centers in Spain. Major technology companies that have announced commitments in the last two years to open cloud computing centers in the country include AWS, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. According to the Spanish Association of Data Centers, the expected investment in developing data centers in Madrid is estimated to be USD 6.72 Million. These planned investments might offer opportunities to U.S.-based SMEs active in cloud and AI solutions and services, as Spanish companies must adapt to digital transformation challenges within the next few years. <br> <br>
                    Additionally, there are opportunities in diverse areas such as cybersecurity, with special focus on zero-trust approaches, and organizational resilience; ICT solutions enabling energy efficiency across different sectors, and digital twin technology which is increasing adoption by Spanish industrial companies.
